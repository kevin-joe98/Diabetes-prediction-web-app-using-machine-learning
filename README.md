This is a diabetes prediction web app using machine learning (support vector machine AKA. svm model which is a classification model.) 
These lines of code represent a simple web application built using Streamlit for predicting diabetes based on input features. Let's break down what each part does:

Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations, pickle for loading the trained model, and Streamlit for creating the web application.

Loading the Model: It loads a pre-trained (trained model.sav) machine learning model from a saved file. The model is presumably trained to predict diabetes based on certain input features.

Defining the Prediction Function: The diabetes_prediction function takes input data, reshapes it, and uses the loaded model to make predictions. It returns a string indicating whether the person is predicted to be diabetic or not.

Main Function: The main function is the core of the web application. It sets up the Streamlit application, defining the input fields for various features like pregnancies, glucose level, etc., and a button to trigger the prediction.

Getting Input Data: Within the main function, Streamlit's text_input function is used to get input values for various features related to diabetes prediction from the user.

Prediction and Display: When the user clicks the "Diabetes Test Result" button, the diabetes_prediction function is called with the input data provided by the user. The result of the prediction (whether the person is diabetic or not) is then displayed as a success message using Streamlit's success function.

Execution: The main function is called if the script is run directly (__name__ == '__main__'). This is where the Streamlit web app gets initialized and executed.
